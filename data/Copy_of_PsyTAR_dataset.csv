Side effects included:

First month or so: going back and forth from being quite and calm to being extremaly anxious without a reason especially about two hours after taking the doze. Very vivid, weird dreams, occasional nightmares every night for about 2 months.

Dialated pupils after a few weeks of taking, to the point of blurred vision. Gone after 2 weeks.

Incredible sweet tooth - couldn't stop myself from eating sweets. Just eat cereal and fruit if you don't want to gain weight. This has subsided after a month or so.

Constipation - didn't go away. I eat youghurts and this helps a little.

I went along hoping against hope that the panic attack I had one day would be the last one. I would go along a few days without one and then be so disappointed to have another one. I was having a lot of these while driving and I was beginning to avoid driving to prevent them. It was getting quite debilitating because my work requires driving to different places at times. 



Now, for the 10 months I've been taking Lexapro, I've only had three instances where I could feel myself going into a panic attack - this is a huge decrease. This Lexapro treatment has at least allowed me to continue driving and going to work. Without it, I would be a mess right now. 



Most of the odd side effects went away the first few weeks after I started taking it. The remaining side effects - weight gain and sleepiness - I'm in the process right now of deciding whether or not I want to live with them.

Honestly, reading any negative reviews on a medication won't help you either...been there, done that and it only makes you more aware of any bad reactions. I have to say so far, so good, well GREAT. It's 3 weeks going on 4 of the 20mg dosage and I actually feel ""semi-normal"" if that makes any sense. I feel hopeful and positive on a more daily basis. My depression is at an all-time low and my anxiety getting better...I have relied on Xanax to calm my panic attacks and now slowly weaning off of it due to the Lexapro! I sure hope this lasts...it's feels so good to finally feel like life is worth living!!!!!!!",F,35,2  years,2009-10-10 0:00:00,ssri

And a feeling of eminent doom 24/7. Like you just saw a dog get hit by a car. They ran entire body scans and told me I was the healthiest person ever. 

Visited the psychologist who prescribed me and he promised if I just stuck with it, it would pass. And he was right! Almost exactly after the second week I woke up one morning and I felt 100% better.  Xanax was the godsend to get me through the side effects. Take it as prescribed and it is your best friend.","I've read nothing but negative reviews on this drug. Some people even claim that the first day of taking the pill it was either aweful or amazing. Just know that you WILL NOT feel any effect for 3-5 days as it takes time for it to build up in your body. 

I started taking this for my Post Partum. I was to the point that if I even looked at my baby or heard his voice I wanted to vomit. I wanted nothing to do with him. I wanted him away from me as far as possible. I knew there was something wrong with that, so I spoke to a psychologist and he prescribed me lexapro. I started off on 2.5 mg for one week. Then 5 the next week (those 2 weeks were the worst) then  I worked up to 10mg. I felt so much better but I still had the feeling of uneasiness. So he bumped me up to 15. That was the magic number. I was totally back to normal.  It's been 1yr now and my little baby is now 1.5 yrs old. I feel like I don't need it any more. So my dr has me stepping off. I've gradually taken down the dose by 2.5mgs each month just to be sure I don't experience withdrawals and guess what?! THERE HAVE BEEN NONE!!! Yay.

479,962,47,cymbalta.47,1,"back pain, depression","Cymbalta has the same adverse side effects of the other SSRI medications and then some. In fact, because of Cymbaltas adverse emotional reactions, the inherent inability to get an erection or orgasm that is more the norm in other SSRI medications appears to be even worse with this one. If that werent enough, it increases anxiety and thus has less value as an anti-depressant. Yet what was even more profound, I found that I was in a state of emotional upset at all times but wasnt aware of it until I stopped the medication 6 days ago. Bizarre sensations of profound guilt and regret about incidents from the past (childhood to adult), were constantly re-lived and extremely inflated to say the least. I found myself on the verge of tears at all times. To add to the constant emotional upset, I can now attribute Cymbalta to frustrating memory lapses and a dramatic compromise in my cognitive abilities which I had mistakenly blamed on my pain medication. This drug caused me t","I have severe and chronic lower back pain with Fibromyalgia which resulted in my developing depression. Consequently, I was placed on anti-depressants to counteract the side effects of pain medication, and also because the constant pain sucked the life out of me. Initially I was on Effexor (YIKES!), but had to stop this drug after only a few days. Subsequently I was placed on Zoloft for several years, then Celexa for several more, and finally Cymbalta in an effort to decrease the SSRI side effects the first two medications had. Each time I switched drugs I had to stop completely to start the other. I had no adverse withdrawal side effects from either Zoloft or Celexa; however Cymbalta was a different story. I had tried several times before to quit Cymbalta but because of the extreme withdrawal side effects, I was forced to stay on it. The evidence for me is irrefutable; Cymbalta has absolutely no redeeming value when compared to any other type of SSRI anti-depressant. In Fact, I believe it should either be removed from the market or be deemed a controlled substance, not because patients would be inclined to abuse this drug, but that physicians are in an effort to improve mood and block pain without having to dispense pain medication. Even the most innocuous of prescribed pain medication has vastly more therapeutic value, simply because Cymbalta has none. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG, IT IS DANGEROUS.

They usually smile back at you :)  Think of positive thoughts even if you have to make them up. I dare you! Buy something new even if its just a pair of underwear.  Women know this really does work wonders. Give it a fair chance, good luck. Aloha~",F,52,5  days,2009-05-01 0:00:00,snri

It helped anxiety slightly, but made my depression worse in my eyes. Despite the slight amount of energy I had, I felt even less motivation to direct it towards anything productive. My inability to think correctly lead me to get frustrated when I tried to get work done, and also lead me to being more rash with decision making. 



Sleeping more did not affect my sleep schedule. In other words; I was up for less hours at a time. Weird dreams is honestly the only good thing about this drug for me. The amount of side effects sure made life even less fun than it already was.



Quitting this drug was horrible. Constantly felt like I was about to faint, felt like my brain was being zapped with an electrical discharge. These were strong feelings, even though I was gradually reducing the amount. I heard taking an SSRI while weaning off helped, since withdrawal from SSRIs is not nearly as bad, but I didn't have that since it was my decision to quit.



This is surprisingly strong stuff. My brain chemistry still feels different, and I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from this. This was my second in line for antidepressants, and if your doctor recommends this so soon, reject it. Try something else before you risk taking this. Getting someone addicted to this so they have to keep buying it is dangerous. It does actually affect your behaviour though, so it may be worth trying if everything else won't work.

I read all the side effects and was reluctant to start it, but knew that I needed to take something in order to function in life.  I am currently on 75 mgs per day and it has made a huge difference.  My advice to anyone considering taking the drug is don't stress out when reading the side effects.  All drugs effect people differently.  Give it a chance.  It took about 14 days for the drug to kick in.   The side effects did go away after about 4 days and when I increased my dose from 37.5 mgs to 75 mgs I didn't have any side  effects.  My Dr. prescribed xanax for me to take along with the   effexor for the first week which actually eliminated the shakiness and nervousness immediately.  I only had to take the xanax for the first three days on the Effexor.  I suggest that  if you decide to take the Effexor, having the xanax on hand for the first few days will help.  I have not had to increase my dosage as of yet.  I'm hoping to be able to stay on the 75 mgs for as long as possible.  Reading about the withdrawals is a little scarey, but like I said, all people are affected differently by different drugs, so I will cross that bridge if and when I get to it.
