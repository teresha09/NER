It at least did something, but the amount of side effects speaks for itself.    It helped anxiety slightly, but made my depression worse in my eyes. Despite the slight amount of energy I had, I felt even less motivation to direct it towards anything productive. My inability to think correctly lead me to get frustrated when I tried to get work done, and also lead me to being more rash with decision making.     Sleeping more did not affect my sleep schedule. In other words; I was up for less hours at a time. Weird dreams is honestly the only good thing about this drug for me. The amount of side effects sure made life even less fun than it already was.    Quitting this drug was horrible. Constantly felt like I was about to faint, felt like my brain was being zapped with an electrical discharge. These were strong feelings, even though I was gradually reducing the amount. I heard taking an SSRI while weaning off helped, since withdrawal from SSRIs is not nearly as bad, but I didn't have that since it was my decision to quit.    This is surprisingly strong stuff. My brain chemistry still feels different, and I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from this. This was my second in line for antidepressants, and if your doctor recommends this so soon, reject it. Try something else before you risk taking this. Getting someone addicted to this so they have to keep buying it is dangerous. It does actually affect your behaviour though, so it may be worth trying if everything else won't work.

Before Effexor XR, I tried: paxil, citalopram, sertraline and trazadone. None of them helped much. Some made me feel worse. Effexor is the first antidepressant that has really helped. And I noticed positive effects from day one. My anxiety is much improved.  I sleep better. I get fewer tension headaches. My energy levels are back to normal. I still sometimes feel unmotivated on waking up in the morning, but I don't want to increase the dose above 75mg because of the anorgasmia, and the potential difficulties in eventually quitting the drug. I did try 150mg a day for a week, but the benefits didn't increase. The main benefits for me are the reduction of anxiety and the improvement in my energy levels. I used to take Ativan for anxiety, but that made me absent-minded. Effexor doesn't make me so absent-minded. It hasn't really lifted my mood much, but my mood wasnt really my problem. My problem was severe debility, brought on, I think, by long-term anxiety.","entities":{"0":{"start":0,"end":19,"entity":"adr","text":"Inability to orgasm"},"1":{"start":55,"end":68,"entity":"adr","text":"Slight apathy"},"2":{"start":73,"end":91,"entity":"adr","text":"abscent-mindedness"},"3":{"start":95,"end":113,"entity":"adr","text":"make lots of typos"},"4":{"start":702,"end":712,"entity":"adr","text":"anorgasmia"},"5":{"start":168,"end":175,"entity":"disease","text":"anxiety"},"6":{"start":879,"end":899,"entity":"disease","text":"reduction of anxiety"},"7":{"start":168,"end":175,"entity":"symptom","text":"anxiety"},"8":{"start":168,"end":175,"entity":"symptom","text":"anxiety"},"9":{"start":908,"end":939,"entity":"symptom","text":"improvement in my energy levels"},"10":{"start":168,"end":175,"entity":"symptom","text":"anxiety"},"11":{"start":1140,"end":1155,"entity":"symptom","text":"severe debility"},"12":{"start":168,"end":175,"entity":"symptom","text":"anxiety"}}},{"index":766,"text":" Sleepy all the time and have put on weight, but not sure if either of these can be directly connected to the drug.","entities":{}},{"index":767,"text":"sweating, severe tremors, chest pain,   Withdrawl side effects: brain flashes, emotional, irrational, aggressive, angry, diahhorea, stomach cramps, vomiting, unable to relax or sleep- these got better after about 2 weeks, but still hanging around extremely hard to withdraw from","entities":{"0":{"start":0,"end":8,"entity":"adr","text":"sweating"},"1":{"start":10,"end":24,"entity":"adr","text":"severe tremors"},"2":{"start":26,"end":36,"entity":"adr","text":"chest pain"}}},{"index":768,"text":"lethargic, unusual dreams, yawning, difficulty reaching orgasm I was diagnosed with \"double depression\"....Started on 37.5 mg for about 2 weeks, no change, only very sleepy, missed worked, switched to taking at night, uppped to 75mg for a week or two, helped a little bit, I was at an extremely depressed point in my life before I started and it got me back to my \"regular\" state of derpression.

I ended up staying on a maintenance dose of half of a 37.5 mg tablet.  After a year or so on this I had more spinal problems and related nerve pain.  Upped the Effexor to 75 mg without much pain relief.  I now switched to XR 150 mg for the past six months.      I have lots of neck problems (DDD, herniation, stenosis, etc) so I thought the severe pain in my hands and arms was the result of that.  HOwever, in thinking about when the pain increased, I realized that it coincided with my switch to a higher dose and XR.  To compound the problem, I was put on Diovan 160 mg for high blood pressure at the same time.  So I don't really know if the increase in pain is related only to the Effexor XR or Diovan also.

I read all the side effects and was reluctant to start it, but knew that I needed to take something in order to function in life.  I am currently on 75 mgs per day and it has made a huge difference.  My advice to anyone considering taking the drug is don't stress out when reading the side effects.  All drugs effect people differently.  Give it a chance.  It took about 14 days for the drug to kick in.   The side effects did go away after about 4 days and when I increased my dose from 37.5 mgs to 75 mgs I didn't have any side  effects.  My Dr. prescribed xanax for me to take along with the   effexor for the first week which actually eliminated the shakiness and nervousness immediately.  I only had to take the xanax for the first three days on the Effexor.  I suggest that  if you decide to take the Effexor, having the xanax on hand for the first few days will help.  I have not had to increase my dosage as of yet.  I'm hoping to be able to stay on the 75 mgs for as long as possible.  Reading about the withdrawals is a little scarey, but like I said, all people are affected differently by different drugs, so I will cross that bridge if and when I get to it.  Effexor has made a huge difference in my life and when and if I have to come off it, if I experience any withdrawals, well, so be it. It would be a small price to pay for  being able to enjoy life.","entities":{"0":{"start":-1,"end":33,"entity":"adr","text":"mild insomnia for the first 3 days"},"1":{"start":59,"end":97,"entity":"adr","text":"extreme shakiness for the first 3 days"}}}]}
