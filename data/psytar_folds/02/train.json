I went along hoping against hope that the panic attack I had one day would be the last one. I would go along a few days without one and then be so disappointed to have another one. I was having a lot of these while driving and I was beginning to avoid driving to prevent them. It was getting quite debilitating because my work requires driving to different places at times.     Now, for the 10 months I've been taking Lexapro, I've only had three instances where I could feel myself going into a panic attack - this is a huge decrease. This Lexapro treatment has at least allowed me to continue driving and going to work. Without it, I would be a mess right now.     Most of the odd side effects went away the first few weeks after I started taking it. The remaining side effects - weight gain and sleepiness - I'm in the process right now of deciding whether or not I want to live with them.

I was carrying out 'risky' behaviours and after 4 weeks of taking it I ended up in the emergency department of the hospital twice in 4 days for over-dosing.

I'm a nurse who works on nightshift. I've always had bouts of depression, I have a history of major anxiety to the point of it being physically painful, and developed OCD over time. When I switched to nights I became a complete mess. I could not even lift my head up because of how depressed I felt, and it scared me. I asked my PNP to give me zoloft, after thinking long and hard. I was extremely skeptical and afraid to take it, terrified to say the least, because I had a horrible reaction to a few other anti-Ds. After having it on my nightstand for about a week, I finally started taking the first weeks 25mg and then upped it to 50mg the following week, which I am on now.  I must say that I noticed a dramatic difference- I'm always tired because of night shift, but I feel NO depression. I find myself able to fully concentrate, despite the slight dizziness and brainfog it gives. I stated I feel apathy, but I believe its because I feel apathy towards things that used to make me sad and depressed, and anxious.  As far as my OCD, I have less trouble dealing with my intrusive thoughts and am not a nervous wreck following my episodes.  Even though I feel slightly numbed out, I notice I'm more relaxed than I have ever been-the brainfog does not interefere with my patient care and safety.  I have not had to take as much lorazepam 0.5mg PRN like before, that is an improvement.

As for depression, I took prozac years ago, and found that much more effective in eliminating my depression. But Prozac also raised the threshold on other feelings, which I didn't like.  Cymbalta seems to have a lower threshold in terms of blocking feelings.  So I still get the good feelings, which I like, but unfortunately I also still get the depression.

Quitting this drug was horrible. Constantly felt like I was about to faint, felt like my brain was being zapped with an electrical discharge. These were strong feelings, even though I was gradually reducing the amount. I heard taking an SSRI while weaning off helped, since withdrawal from SSRIs is not nearly as bad, but I didn't have that since it was my decision to quit.    This is surprisingly strong stuff. My brain chemistry still feels different, and I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from this. This was my second in line for antidepressants, and if your doctor recommends this so soon, reject it.

I ended up staying on a maintenance dose of half of a 37.5 mg tablet.  After a year or so on this I had more spinal problems and related nerve pain.  Upped the Effexor to 75 mg without much pain relief.  I now switched to XR 150 mg for the past six months.      I have lots of neck problems (DDD, herniation, stenosis, etc) so I thought the severe pain in my hands and arms was the result of that.  HOwever, in thinking about when the pain increased, I realized that it coincided with my switch to a higher dose and XR.  To compound the problem, I was put on Diovan 160 mg for high blood pressure at the same time.  So I don't really know if the increase in pain is related only to the Effexor XR or Diovan also. Overall, Effexor did very well relieving my depression.  It helped keep migraines at bay and I had tolerable, minimal side effects.  But getting off of this drug is really nasty.  I had to d\/c my meds a few days before a neck myelogram and had a very bad reaction to the lack of Effexor in my system.  My pain increased tremendously and I was a basket case emotionally with crying, etc. I had to go back on the Effexor and make an appointment with my prescriber to find something to cover me for when I have the myelogram.

I read all the side effects and was reluctant to start it, but knew that I needed to take something in order to function in life.  I am currently on 75 mgs per day and it has made a huge difference.  My advice to anyone considering taking the drug is don't stress out when reading the side effects.  All drugs effect people differently.  Give it a chance.  It took about 14 days for the drug to kick in.   The side effects did go away after about 4 days and when I increased my dose from 37.5 mgs to 75 mgs I didn't have any side  effects.  My Dr. prescribed xanax for me to take along with the   effexor for the first week which actually eliminated the shakiness and nervousness immediately.  I only had to take the xanax for the first three days on the Effexor.  I suggest that  if you decide to take the Effexor, having the xanax on hand for the first few days will help.  I have not had to increase my dosage as of yet.  I'm hoping to be able to stay on the 75 mgs for as long as possible.  Reading about the withdrawals is a little scarey, but like I said, all people are affected differently by different drugs, so I will cross that bridge if and when I get to it.  Effexor has made a huge difference in my life and when and if I have to come off it, if I experience any withdrawals, well, so be it.
