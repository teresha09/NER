I've increased my fiber through my diet -lots of fresh fruit and veggies, that seems to help.  Nausea is pretty much gone, and my sleep pattern seems to be normalizing now. For the first few weeks I was on it I had intense dreams, some of them unpleasant.  If I was able to finally get to sleep, the sleep was not good.  That has also subsided.  This drug has saved my life. After 2 months I am feeling mentally normal again. I am slowly getting my life back from severe depression. This is a hard drug to stick with, I was REALLY sick at first. It really does get better.  Just DON'T miss a dose.  24 hours after missing a dose the withdrawal is really intense and you are really sick until about 3 hours after you take a dose.  I've suffered with PMDD for years, and I always know when I am about to start when the PMDD starts up.  I can get so depressed right before my period that I would be downright suicidal, cry uncontrollably, have passive aggressive tendencies,  and that is gone.  This month I did not even know I was about to start!  I don't know how I will ever get off this drug when the time comes, because of the withdrawals.  For now it has drastically changed my life for the better, so I will just have to cross that bridge when I get there.","entities":{"0":{"start":-1,"end":20,"entity":"adr","text":"First Month: insomnia"},"1":{"start":-1,"end":24,"entity":"adr","text":"First Month: constipation"},"2":{"start":-1,"end":18,"entity":"adr","text":"First Month: nausea"},"3":{"start":-1,"end":22,"entity":"adr","text":"First Month: exhaustion"},"4":{"start":362,"end":404,"entity":"adr","text":"Constipation was really bad in first month"},"5":{"start":-1,"end":25,"entity":"adr","text":"nausea is pretty much gone"},"6":{"start":-1,"end":29,"entity":"adr","text":"sleep pattern, normalizing now"},"7":{"start":-1,"end":30,"entity":"adr","text":"first few weeks, intense dreams"},"8":{"start":686,"end":723,"entity":"adr","text":"If I was able to finally get to sleep"},"9":{"start":729,"end":747,"entity":"adr","text":"sleep was not good"},"10":{"start":-1,"end":19,"entity":"adr","text":"really sick at first"},"11":{"start":893,"end":910,"entity":"disease","text":"severe depression"},"12":{"start":1178,"end":1182,"entity":"disease","text":"PMDD"},"13":{"start":1335,"end":1343,"entity":"disease","text":"suicidal"},"14":{"start":1345,"end":1363,"entity":"disease","text":"cry uncontrollably"},"15":{"start":1370,"end":1399,"entity":"disease","text":"passive aggressive tendencies"},"16":{"start":1276,"end":1285,"entity":"disease","text":"depressed"},"17":{"start":893,"end":910,"entity":"symptom","text":"severe depression"},"18":{"start":1178,"end":1182,"entity":"symptom","text":"PMDD"},"19":{"start":1178,"end":1182,"entity":"symptom","text":"PMDD"},"20":{"start":1276,"end":1285,"entity":"symptom","text":"depressed"},"21":{"start":1335,"end":1343,"entity":"symptom","text":"suicidal"},"22":{"start":1345,"end":1363,"entity":"symptom","text":"cry uncontrollably"}}},{"index":653,"text":"First week - Nausea, dizziness, no appetite.
