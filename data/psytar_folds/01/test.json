I love the effects of this med, except that now I am noticing weight gain (7lbs in last 2 mo.)thats not coming off with diet and exercise, so I am switching to Wellbutrin SR, and hopefully will have success with my mood and get back to a body fat % I am happy with.  It gets a \"4\" because of weight gain and how long it took to work (2 months). Otherwise, it's a 5.","entities":{"0":{"start":0,"end":11,"entity":"adr","text":"weight gain"},"1":{"start":16,"end":29,"entity":"adr","text":"jaw clenching"},"2":{"start":0,"end":11,"entity":"adr","text":"weight gain"},"3":{"start":0,"end":11,"entity":"adr","text":"weight gain"},"4":{"start":70,"end":77,"entity":"disease","text":"anxiety"},"5":{"start":108,"end":136,"entity":"disease","text":"clenched feeling in my chest"},"6":{"start":471,"end":480,"entity":"disease","text":"depressed"},"7":{"start":482,"end":491,"entity":"disease","text":"lethargic"},"8":{"start":507,"end":512,"entity":"disease","text":"upset"},"9":{"start":792,"end":800,"entity":"disease","text":"paranoia"},"10":{"start":70,"end":77,"entity":"symptom","text":"anxiety"},"11":{"start":108,"end":136,"entity":"symptom","text":"clenched feeling in my chest"},"12":{"start":226,"end":236,"entity":"symptom","text":"depression"},"13":{"start":471,"end":480,"entity":"symptom","text":"depressed"},"14":{"start":481,"end":491,"entity":"symptom","text":" lethargic"},"15":{"start":507,"end":512,"entity":"symptom","text":"upset"},"16":{"start":792,"end":800,"entity":"symptom","text":"paranoia"}}},{"index":343,"text":"Jittery, clenching\/grinding teeth, insomnia, lack of libido It certainly works for what I'm taking it for, but sometimes it can be very hard to handle the side effects I experience with it.","entities":{"0":{"start":0,"end":7,"entity":"adr","text":"Jittery"},"1":{"start":-1,"end":14,"entity":"adr","text":"clenching teeth"},"2":{"start":19,"end":33,"entity":"adr","text":"grinding teeth"},"3":{"start":35,"end":43,"entity":"adr","text":"insomnia"},"4":{"start":45,"end":59,"entity":"adr","text":"lack of libido"}}},{"index":344,"text":"Severe diarrhea, which caused bad abdominal cramping It worked better than any other medication I have ever taken for depression.

People look at you strange when you wear short sleeves in 40 degree weather.  ;)  HOWEVER, it did help a majority of the time, especially in the first 2 years.
