Zoloft totally changed my life for the better. The difference was like night and day with feeling like i had a purpose in the world and motivation and joy. in the last 6 months I feel like Zoloft has stopped working...i have great social anxiety again, lots of self-doubt, have not felt joy in a very long time. even though zoloft worked well for so long i have wanted to go off for years due to trendyness\/social stigma and belief that i should be able to handle this w\/o meds but have had much trouble with the withdrawal the 2 times i tried. now that i am feeling bad again i wonder if it would be a good time to try going off because the drop might be less than if i were feeling great. i never liked the idea of being on zoloft but i can't deny that it worked brilliantly for years.","entities":{"0":{"start":0,"end":12,"entity":"adr","text":"Night sweats"},"1":{"start":32,"end":43,"entity":"adr","text":"loose stool"},"2":{"start":59,"end":106,"entity":"adr","text":"difficulty reaching orgasm when i first when on"},"3":{"start":171,"end":194,"entity":"adr","text":"orgasm is very elusive "},"4":{"start":607,"end":621,"entity":"symptom","text":"social anxiety"},"5":{"start":637,"end":647,"entity":"symptom","text":"self-doubt"},"6":{"start":654,"end":666,"entity":"symptom","text":"not felt joy"}}},{"index":366,"text":"slight headache ","entities":{"0":{"start":0,"end":15,"entity":"adr","text":"slight headache"}}},{"index":367,"text":"Neck stiffness and pain, Headache, Muscle pain in legs and lower back, Difficult sleep I just wanted to report on day 1 of use and will continue to update as I go.

As I've already noted, Zoloft is working very well for me. 4.5 months ago when I was researching Zoloft on-line, it seemed that the only people who wrote comments about Zoloft were those with horrible experiences, or had some other negative thing to say about it. Needless to say I was discouraged, very fearful and skeptical to try Zoloft for my first time. I felt I was relatively normal, with just mild depression and anxiety, I certainly did not want to make my situation WORSE!

","entities":{}},{"index":478,"text":"Cymbalta has the same adverse side effects of the other SSRI medications and then some. In fact, because of Cymbaltas adverse emotional reactions, the inherent inability to get an erection or orgasm that is more the norm in other SSRI medications appears to be even worse with this one. If that werent enough, it increases anxiety and thus has less value as an anti-depressant. Yet what was even more profound, I found that I was in a state of emotional upset at all times but wasnt aware of it until I stopped the medication 6 days ago. Bizarre sensations of profound guilt and regret about incidents from the past (childhood to adult), were constantly re-lived and extremely inflated to say the least. I found myself on the verge of tears at all times. To add to the constant emotional upset, I can now attribute Cymbalta to frustrating memory lapses and a dramatic compromise in my cognitive abilities which I had mistakenly blamed on my pain medication. This drug caused me t I have severe and chronic lower back pain with Fibromyalgia which resulted in my developing depression. Consequently, I was placed on anti-depressants to counteract the side effects of pain medication, and also because the constant pain sucked the life out of me. Initially I was on Effexor (YIKES!), but had to stop this drug after only a few days. Subsequently I was placed on Zoloft for several years, then Celexa for several more, and finally Cymbalta in an effort to decrease the SSRI side effects the first two medications had. Each time I switched drugs I had to stop completely to start the other. I had no adverse withdrawal side effects from either Zoloft or Celexa; however Cymbalta was a different story. I had tried several times before to quit Cymbalta but because of the extreme withdrawal side effects, I was forced to stay on it. The evidence for me is irrefutable; Cymbalta has absolutely no redeeming value when compared to any other type of SSRI anti-depressant. In Fact, I believe it should either be removed from the market or be deemed a controlled substance, not because patients would be inclined to abuse this drug, but that physicians are in an effort to improve mood and block pain without having to dispense pain medication. Even the most innocuous of prescribed pain medication has vastly more therapeutic value, simply because Cymbalta has none. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG, IT IS DANGEROUS.

I ended up staying on a maintenance dose of half of a 37.5 mg tablet.  After a year or so on this I had more spinal problems and related nerve pain.  Upped the Effexor to 75 mg without much pain relief.  I now switched to XR 150 mg for the past six months.      I have lots of neck problems (DDD, herniation, stenosis, etc) so I thought the severe pain in my hands and arms was the result of that.  HOwever, in thinking about when the pain increased, I realized that it coincided with my switch to a higher dose and XR.  To compound the problem, I was put on Diovan 160 mg for high blood pressure at the same time.  So I don't really know if the increase in pain is related only to the Effexor XR or Diovan also. Overall, Effexor did very well relieving my depression.  It helped keep migraines at bay and I had tolerable, minimal side effects.  But getting off of this drug is really nasty.  I had to d\/c my meds a few days before a neck myelogram and had a very bad reaction to the lack of Effexor in my system.  My pain increased tremendously and I was a basket case emotionally with crying, etc. I had to go back on the Effexor and make an appointment with my prescriber to find something to cover me for when I have the myelogram.

I read all the side effects and was reluctant to start it, but knew that I needed to take something in order to function in life.  I am currently on 75 mgs per day and it has made a huge difference.  My advice to anyone considering taking the drug is don't stress out when reading the side effects.  All drugs effect people differently.  Give it a chance.  It took about 14 days for the drug to kick in.   The side effects did go away after about 4 days and when I increased my dose from 37.5 mgs to 75 mgs I didn't have any side  effects.  My Dr. prescribed xanax for me to take along with the   effexor for the first week which actually eliminated the shakiness and nervousness immediately.  I only had to take the xanax for the first three days on the Effexor.  I suggest that  if you decide to take the Effexor, having the xanax on hand for the first few days will help.  I have not had to increase my dosage as of yet.  I'm hoping to be able to stay on the 75 mgs for as long as possible.  Reading about the withdrawals is a little scarey, but like I said, all people are affected differently by different drugs, so I will cross that bridge if and when I get to it.  Effexor has made a huge difference in my life and when and if I have to come off it, if I experience any withdrawals, well, so be it.
