I went along hoping against hope that the panic attack I had one day would be the last one. I would go along a few days without one and then be so disappointed to have another one. I was having a lot of these while driving and I was beginning to avoid driving to prevent them. It was getting quite debilitating because my work requires driving to different places at times.     Now, for the 10 months I've been taking Lexapro, I've only had three instances where I could feel myself going into a panic attack - this is a huge decrease. This Lexapro treatment has at least allowed me to continue driving and going to work. Without it, I would be a mess right now.     Most of the odd side effects went away the first few weeks after I started taking it. The remaining side effects - weight gain and sleepiness - I'm in the process right now of deciding whether or not I want to live with them.

It's 3 weeks going on 4 of the 20mg dosage and I actually feel \"semi-normal\" if that makes any sense. I feel hopeful and positive on a more daily basis. My depression is at an all-time low and my anxiety getting better...I have relied on Xanax to calm my panic attacks and now slowly weaning off of it due to the Lexapro! I sure hope this lasts...it's feels so good to finally feel like life is worth living!!!!!!!","entities":{"0":{"start":-1,"end":43,"entity":"adr","text":"increased anxiety , only for first few weeks"},"1":{"start":-1,"end":38,"entity":"adr","text":"sleeplessness, only for first few weeks"},"2":{"start":-1,"end":44,"entity":"adr","text":"increased appetite , only for first few weeks"},"3":{"start":-1,"end":46,"entity":"adr","text":"increased sensitivity, only for first few weeks"},"4":{"start":852,"end":862,"entity":"disease","text":"depression"},"5":{"start":10,"end":17,"entity":"disease","text":"anxiety"},"6":{"start":951,"end":964,"entity":"disease","text":"panic attacks"},"7":{"start":10,"end":17,"entity":"symptom","text":"anxiety"},"8":{"start":64,"end":75,"entity":"symptom","text":"sensitivity"},"9":{"start":852,"end":862,"entity":"symptom","text":"depression"},"10":{"start":10,"end":17,"entity":"symptom","text":"anxiety"},"11":{"start":951,"end":964,"entity":"symptom","text":"panic attacks"}}},{"index":175,"text":"headache, dizziness, loss of sex drive, insomnia I have only been taking lexapro for three weeks but I am thrilled with the results so far.

I think the combo makes me itch all over. Its been doing this for about a year. I think the Lexapro helps a lot but it seems like something is still lacking in my mental\/emotional state. Like it almost works great most of the time but something is still missing for it to be just right.  maybe it never will but Im hopeful. Ive increased to 50mg but it didnt really seem to make a difference, so I tried 60. That put me right over the edge. So 40 seems to work best for me.

I had no clue it was the side effect from the lexapro. I checked myself into the ER 3x in one week certain that I was dying. I vomited for three days straight. Heart palpitations for 2 weeks. Along with the \"brain zaps\" people tell about. And a feeling of eminent doom 24\/7. Like you just saw a dog get hit by a car. They ran entire body scans and told me I was the healthiest person ever.   Visited the psychologist who prescribed me and he promised if I just stuck with it, it would pass. And he was right! Almost exactly after the second week I woke up one morning and I felt 100% better.  Xanax was the godsend to get me through the side effects. Take it as prescribed and it is your best friend. I've read nothing but negative reviews on this drug. Some people even claim that the first day of taking the pill it was either aweful or amazing. Just know that you WILL NOT feel any effect for 3-5 days as it takes time for it to build up in your body.   I started taking this for my Post Partum. I was to the point that if I even looked at my baby or heard his voice I wanted to vomit. I wanted nothing to do with him. I wanted him away from me as far as possible. I knew there was something wrong with that, so I spoke to a psychologist and he prescribed me lexapro. I started off on 2.5 mg for one week. Then 5 the next week (those 2 weeks were the worst) then  I worked up to 10mg. I felt so much better but I still had the feeling of uneasiness. So he bumped me up to 15. That was the magic number. I was totally back to normal.  It's been 1yr now and my little baby is now 1.5 yrs old. I feel like I don't need it any more. So my dr has me stepping off. I've gradually taken down the dose by 2.5mgs each month just to be sure I don't experience withdrawals and guess what?! THERE HAVE BEEN NONE!!! Yay. I'm literally down to my last 30 days of this medicine and I feel awesome!  DO NOT JUST QUIT COLD TURKEY. you must must must gradually lower the dose by a month at a time or you will suffer TERRIBLE consequences.","entities":{"0":{"start":91,"end":133,"entity":"adr","text":"checked myself into the ER 3x in one week "},"1":{"start":161,"end":192,"entity":"adr","text":"vomited for three days straight"},"2":{"start":194,"end":224,"entity":"adr","text":"Heart palpitations for 2 weeks"},"3":{"start":242,"end":252,"entity":"adr","text":"brain zaps"},"4":{"start":279,"end":307,"entity":"adr","text":"feeling of eminent doom 24\/7"},"5":{"start":1020,"end":1031,"entity":"disease","text":"Post Partum"},"6":{"start":1020,"end":1031,"entity":"symptom","text":"Post Partum"},"7":{"start":1067,"end":1121,"entity":"symptom","text":"looked at my baby or heard his voice I wanted to vomit"},"8":{"start":1125,"end":1154,"entity":"symptom","text":"wanted nothing to do with him"},"9":{"start":1157,"end":1200,"entity":"symptom","text":" wanted him away from me as far as possible"},"10":{"start":1464,"end":1485,"entity":"symptom","text":"feeling of uneasiness"}}},{"index":178,"text":"Sleepiness...all the time, yet will have trouble falling asleep at night, can nap for half a day no problem.
