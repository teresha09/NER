Legs and toes were numb (worse in left), weak, back pain and calves hurt terribly. Walking was possible but only with intense effort and pain. Couldn't stand for more than 1 or 2 minutes-too painful and weak. Waited a couple 3 weeks to see if it would clear up-did not. Went to doc. Took x-rays said everything fine, blood test fine. Interested in doing MRI-thinking nacrotic nerve in lower spine. On an aside he said stop taking lipitor on an off chanch it may be an uncommon reaction. I started looking up lipitor reactions and came across so much info on side effects it was startling. I look back to about 1 1\/2 years ago when I no longer had that special feeling that all males experience in my organ and a decreased sex drive (not typical for me). At the time I attributed it to male menopause-being around 54. I went to my accupuncturist and was told my chee was dry. Had 4 treatments over as many weeks. Started to see some improvement. At the onset of symptoms I felt like I would imagine someone that had MS would feel like, swaying, pulling myself up stairs, dragging legs. After having stopped lipitor and acupuncture treatments, I would say I am at about 50 or 55%. I hope I continue to keep getting better as this has really hit my life at a bad time. My cholesterol did go down but If I knew I would have these kinds of problems I would never have started taking the drug nor will I EVER AGAIN take it irregardless of my cholesterol level.

The pain was so bad I could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take Advil. I asked my doctor what could have caused this and he said it was probably from the Lipitor. Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep. I had just gotten over a urinery tract infection (one of the side-effects) and I thought it had returned but the symptoms were different. I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again. I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing. I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency. I also had been experiencing lack of energy for quite some time and I attributed this to stress but after reading this website I feel it was due to the Lipitor also. I don't think I will take this drug anymore and since I read that taking vitamin C can help you with your cholesterol I think I will try this method instead. I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects.

But it also significantly lowered my quality of life. This website has been an absolute lifeline for me. My doctor had seemed so completely unwilling to accept that my symptoms could've possibly been related to my taking Lipitor. However, I know my body and know when things are not as they should be. I have been feeling this way since almost immediately after I took my first dose. Hearing that so many other people have experienced the same exact symptoms as me has given me the courage needed to STOP this medication. So many of my family members and friends have had bad reactions to this stuff- I can not trust it, and will be looking for another way to get my cholesterol under control, if possible. Be very careful and very informed before you start any new medication. Don't always trust the word of your doctor as the only word and take it at its face value.

Pain was worse in the morning but rarely went away completely during the day. Most mornings it was impossible to wash my hair in the shower as I was unable to reach the top of my head with my hands. Pain and restricted movement often prevented me from putting on shoes and socks without assistance. In January this year I started experiencing discomfort in my left hand for the first time. Now in both hands, the pain has increased, fingers are swollen and movement is restricted. My wife tells me my hands are warm to touch. The mornings are worse when they hurt the most, movement is restricted and it is impossible to make a fist. Ice and ibruprofen gel help but only for a short while. I have been taking 400 mg Ibruprofen 3 times daily for a couple of weeks on my doctors advice without. This drug is clearly POISON to so many people and perhaps there is good reason to take Pfizer to the courts. However I do believe that any Doctor prescribing Lipitor should make it abundantly clear to the patient that very serious consequences could ensue that would cause extreme pain and could effect quality of life. I believe that failure to do so is a serious deriliction of duty that should be tested with complaints to the medical authorities that oversee our doctors and\/or the courts.

I have tried all the statin drugs, you know the very expensive drug of choice for all the doc's out there. For all of you who now have extremely low LDL and a bad case of joint pain to the extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug, it is from the statins. The drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make CoQ10. This is necessary for they health of muscles and joints (that's why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness). Remember your heart is a muscle, guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the CoQ10??? If you do some research on the internet, you will find that all these statins make no claims\/nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks, but they cause muscle problems i.e. your heart, this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and. I would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130, neurosurgeons, who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low. And just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don't show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn't mean the lack of CoQ10 isn't breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly. Mine always showed fine and I had severe arthritis symptoms in knees and hip joints (never had this in my life before statins) and bad muscle cramps (also never got those until statins). Granted is you have high blood pressure, high LDL, over weight and maybe smoke, then you probably need something to lower the LDL, if you only have high LDL, you don't. Read the drug company studies, they even say it may help prevent a heart attack when you have 3 of the aforementioned risk factors.

About a week ago I was taking a bath and my muscles in my lower abdomen started to contract then the cramp got higher. I got scared that I was having something bad.

I suspected that it was the Lipitor and came to the internet and read the same side effects in a lot of people posting their experiences with this drug. I even thought that I had ALS since a friend of mine died of it. It is amazing the amount of people that also thought the same in this list. Thanks God for the Internet.

He was not happy with my decision and offered a switch to a different statin, I declined. He got aggitated and asked what articles I had been reading and where I got my information. I told him I didn't need a medical journal to convince me this stuff was messing me up, I was living proof. 4-5 days after stopping the Lipitor it was like someonebrought the sun out.

About 6 mons. ago, I decided to tell my Dr I was having muscle pain and leg cramps. He switched to Pravachol 20mg. I lasted about 2 weeks. The pain was worse. Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain. It was Statin. I looked that up and found what it does to the body. So, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up. Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10. 2 months later, the pain was back. Twice as bad as before, plus a whole bunch of other side effects, you see I'm seriuosly allergic to the Statin. And I know now, why I should have known this, but no one told me about it. When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically. When ever I drank, sipped a little wine, by body hurt so bad, I thought I had the flu. And no Aleve, or pain killer would help. I thought I was allergic to the alcohol. But now I know it was the Statin. Here are a list of the side-effects I had, that started slowly and in two years, became unbearable: Insomina,abnoraml dreams, depression, memory loss, photosensitivity, muscle pain, leg cramps, rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, dry skin, tinnitus (left ear) taste loss, dry eyes, weight gain and finally hypertension. During the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these syptoms started out slowly. First came the tinnitus. My Dr sent me to the ear Dr. Found no problem, I would have to live with it. Second, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft. Then came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinocort. During all this I felt like I was 80 years old. My neck hurt, my hips hurt. We got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain. Didn't really help. Insomia was constant. I got hooked on Tylenol PM. I gained a lot of weight. Went to Lindora to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor. Lost 40 lbs. Dr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention. This is when I decided to check it out on the internet. When I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding. That night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it. Then two days later I came down with bronhitis, and asthma. I have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years. Then I had sinus problems again. My Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear. My Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198\/90. I have never in my life had high blood pressure. Dr put me on Norvasc. Then I had two horrible nightmares. I finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor. When I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died. I have all the syptoms. I stopped taking Lipitor that instant. That was one week ago. I'm starting feel a little better. I've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem. He said, no. There is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol. The Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles. I also, asked for physical theraphy for my left shoulder and neck. My left shoulder is almost immobile. I think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor. I hope it goes away soon. I also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing. I would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug. Dr was thinking about putting on another Statin drug. I said, don't you get it, I'm allergic to it. .

New doc gave me a different statin but I had leg cramps so he put me on Baycol. Baycol was removed from market so next doc put me back on Lipitor. My cholesterol level increased to slightly over 200 so my doc increased dosage to 40 mg a day. Hand and leg cramps returned. Hands diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome and I wore a hand brace to sleep several nights a week which controlled the symptoms. Recently developed inflammation of my foot muscles and joints and (apparently) plantar fasciitis of my left foot. Doc prescribed 800 mg Motrin qid but the foot problems became worse. General weakness in my feet, calves, and hands and tingling and burning in the soles of my feet. Depression, for which I've been taking an SSRI for about two years and may not be related to the Lipitor. I had high cholesterol (over 350) and was prescribed Lipitor in 1996 after other methods failed to have much effect. I have taken two stress tests over the past ten years and was told I had a healthy cardiovascular system with no trace of heart disease. I am 6' tall, weighed 177 lbs., and considered myself healthy until recently. I need to be able to pass a physical readiness test, including a 1.5 mile run, every 6 months because I'm in the military. I took myself off Lipitor because I can not take the physical readiness test. In fact I need a cane in the morning to get out of bed. I am not overweight. I was told to stretch and exercise more but that has not helped my symptoms, which have continued to worsen. Until recently I walked to work and shopping, 4 or 5 miles most weekdays, and more on the weekends. I also ran 2 miles, 3 times a week. Now I have difficulty walking and problems with my balance and I've gained 10 pounds because I've become sedentary. Two days after taking myself off Lipitor my feet have improved a little and I'm looking forward to resuming a more active lifestyle. I think my symptoms are a result of Lipitor.

I couldn't move because of the pain, couldn't sleep or woke up at 11am and could get out of bed, made very irrational moves while driving, couldn't remember where I left my dog 10 minutes before or who I had dinner with last night, had miniscus surgery 3 months ago and now it is painful again, constipation and stomach pain, always hungry. GREAT STUFF. I'll take my chances without it thanks. Quality of life is more important a number, and I can't stand the smell of tiger balm anymore!! I think more reseach is needed, something is not right here.

DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!. I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol. The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor. Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years. I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped. My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled. So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem. I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately. Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office. So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again. This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against. I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing. I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again. I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time. This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug. This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage. My doctor, when I told him of all this, wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol. I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor. He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said, well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect, but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed. I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up! I advise, DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!.

Within 72 hours I noted an improvement; within seven days, the symptoms were completely gone and I was restored to health.

Pfizer Inc.(maker of Lipitor) AMOUNT AT ISSUE: $$$ Pending, Cholesterol-Fighting Drug Tied to Liver, Kidney Injury, The Kahn Gauthier Law Group is investigating possible legal actions against Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), to recover for liver or kidney damage suffered by patients prescribed Lipitor. Like other drugs in its class (the statins), Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes. In clinical trials, this occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients, but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose. Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream., Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness--most commonly in the calves and lower back. Malaise, fever, dark urine, vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms. The most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure, occurring in 30-40% of the cases. Some of the warning signs of liver failure are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, and generalized skin discoloration.

Discussed it with my PA and cardiologist. My PA stopped the Lipitor. The pain lessened but did not stop. Went to a Ortho MD who gave me 3 Steroid shots and PT.

Decided against surgery. Both shoulders started to feel better but still couldn't sleep on my left side. My LDL's were through the roof. After almost 10 months off Lipitor, my general MD talked me into starting Sinivastatin 40 mg every day. Well, guess what happened. My shoulder pain suddenly worsen, especially left side.

I have a high tolerance for pain, so the pain wasn't an issue, but I feel like I've aged 20 years! I've slowed down considerably and don't have the tolerance I once did. My short-term memory disappeared. Not that I would have noticed, but my wife was getting increasingly mad at my apparent lack of attention! I'm going off this drug and trying the vitamin C approach. Else, the heck with it. Through exercise, I'll keep my HDL high and work on the ratio rule. I'm convinced this drug will kill me before any possible heart disease!.

Then my neck started getting stiff and the muscles are like boards they're so tight. Now the pain has gone into my shoulder and upper arm on my left side. Just last week I noticed my right arm is tight also. I can't sleep on either shoulder now. My lower back is also tight again! And I get terrible headaches from the tight neck muscles. I googled muscle pain and Lipitor showed up on the first 6 or 7 entries!! I read all the comments on this page and couldn't believe it!! I see my symptoms over and over! So, I had blood tests done this week and have elevated creatine so was told today to stop Lipitor immediately, and will see my doctor next week. After reading all these comments, I have no doubt that Lipitor is the cause of all this discomfort. I just hope and pray that I can recover from these terrible side effects. I will use vitamin C and other natural things to help my cholesterol. but if that doesn't help. hey. I'd rather die from a heart attack than die a slow painful death on Lipitor.

The patient data is reported for him by me. Briefly, my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer (glial cell related cancer). That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor -- he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis. There were no warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards. My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient. He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards). I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this. My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden, unable to speak, feed himself, do anything for himself in 10 days. Don't know if this will really help anybody -- but just please be cautious with Rx medicines and advocate for yourself; you may not know everthing, but you do know best about what you are experiencing with these Rxs. keep doing your research, tell your doctor anything you find relevent about your life as it relates to Rxs you are given, and advocate hard for your quality of life.
