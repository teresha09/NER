This was a big relief, as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing. I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick. HOWEVER: I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn't work. I still had the other Arthrotec pills left, so I took one. Although it alleviated the pain, I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week. I was relieved to read that this could be a side effect, as it means I probably don't have something serious, but I will have to be in some serious pain to risk bleeding from the vagina again. Next time I'll try my luck with Paracetamol. The pill I took consisted of 50 MG Diclofenac and 200 MG Misoprostol.

The doc put me on birth control. But, the bleeding has not subsided. So now I am scheduled to have an endometrial biopsy on Wed. I had an ephiphany last night about Arthrotec and began researching the side effect. When I came across this website, I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy\/extra vaginal bleeding. I firmly believe this is the answer to my bleeding problem and will be telling the doctor on Monday,. Although this drug has helped with the pain, it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly., On top of that, I am now having to have a procedure that a 31 year old should not have to endure. I truly hope that there are no long term effects from this. I have not taken Arthrotec in almost a week, yet I am still bleeding. I do not look forward to the extra pains I will llkely experience in a couple weeks, but I am sure I can find something else to deal with them.

I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion, no signs of acid reflux, so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication. The first day I took both pills, I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps. I was at work, so I just had to brush it off. It continued each time I took it. After about two days (two doses), the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start). So, I googled the side effects of the drug, came across this site, and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects, so I felt a little better about it. On the evening of 4\/30, I suddenly got some serious chest pains, an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an \"I just finished running!\" heart rate), hot flashes, dizziness, sever stomach cramps, and weakness in my legs. I literally thought I was dying. It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day. At work (5\/1), I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened. I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work. A friend at work had to call an ambulance.

The pain lessened by following all these recommendations but I was still uncomfortable a lot of the time. I finally went to see the orthopedist in March and he said my foot \"can\" improve if I continued with the exercises, etc At the very end, he asked if he had given me the \"patch\" at my first appointment; so I left with a sample and a prescription for the Flector patch. I cut a patch (there are five in each reclosable pouch) in half and it covers the heel area. After I used it the first time, the puffiness and pain were gone! I found it best to use the patch at night only although you can replace it every 12 hours. I put the patch on at bedtime, tape the edges down and wear a sock to secure it. Initially, I used it every night and after about three weeks, was able to cut down to several times a week. It certainly helped to make the past month more comfortable.

Now a week later, I feel like I've been run over by a truck. I started having extreme muscle discomfort, achiness, cramps. I assumed it was due to my half-marathon training. I ran five miles last Saturday and expected to be sore for a day. But it has continued and gotten worse each day. I also started have muscle aches in my neck and shoulders and lower back. I couldn't figure out why. I also have felt extremely fatigued and people are telling me I look really tired and asking if I'm ok. I feel like I'm in a fog and it's a chore to just walk around. Last night right.

I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery. First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor's psychiatric side effects. He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10mg Crestor. In addition, he prescribed a new medication: Niacin, beginning with 500mg the first month and then increasing to 1,000 in the second (with the ultimate aim of reaching 2,000 in the fourth monthly). Bottom line: When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165. This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124. So, after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects. Therefore, here is what I've done during the past two months: - Took 500mg of Niacin during the first months and 1,000mg during the second; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills (10mg which are equivalent to 20mg of Lipitor) per month, i.e., one every three days. - Two natural pills of Phytosterol. - A cup of tea made of olive leafs. Now, I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months (2,000mg) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 (the level required for diabetics). Good luck, folks!.

Homeopathy simply does not work - it is just water - The supplements that do work may also have side effects, just like the drugs. Red Yeast Rice, for example, actually contains a statin (lovastatin) , so it will most likely have all the set of side effects as the other statins.

I stopped Lipitor six months ago as an experiment. Within 3 weeks I had recovered about 50%. I hve not recovered past this point. I still can't walk without extreme pain. I have to wear ankle supports, night splints, ice compresses frequently, gel pads, elevated heels. My shoulders are doing better than my ankles and feet, but they still hurt. My GP and the surgeon who says I now need surgery on both ankles for the inflammed bursae are reluctant to connect my pain and disability. My GP still wants me on statins. She is annoyed that I will not take any. I am taking Red Yeast Rice with COQ10 now instead of a statin along with 2000 mg of Vitamin C daily. Basically Lipitor has ruined my formerly active life. No more dancing, golf, hiking, even standing too long sets my ankles on fire. I will have my cholesterol rechecked in September to see if the Red Yeast Rice helps my elevated cholesterol.
