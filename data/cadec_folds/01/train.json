This was a big relief, as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing. I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick. HOWEVER: I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn't work. I still had the other Arthrotec pills left, so I took one. Although it alleviated the pain, I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week.

The doc put me on birth control. But, the bleeding has not subsided. So now I am scheduled to have an endometrial biopsy on Wed. I had an ephiphany last night about Arthrotec and began researching the side effect. When I came across this website, I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy\/extra vaginal bleeding. I firmly believe this is the answer to my bleeding problem and will be telling the doctor on Monday,. Although this drug has helped with the pain, it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly., On top of that, I am now having to have a procedure that a 31 year old should not have to endure. I truly hope that there are no long term effects from this. I have not taken Arthrotec in almost a week, yet I am still bleeding. I do not look forward to the extra pains I will llkely experience in a couple weeks, but I am sure I can find something else to deal with them.

I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion, no signs of acid reflux, so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication. The first day I took both pills, I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps. I was at work, so I just had to brush it off. It continued each time I took it. After about two days (two doses), the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start). So, I googled the side effects of the drug, came across this site, and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects, so I felt a little better about it. On the evening of 4\/30, I suddenly got some serious chest pains, an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an \"I just finished running!\" heart rate), hot flashes, dizziness, sever stomach cramps, and weakness in my legs. I literally thought I was dying. It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day. At work (5\/1), I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened.

The pain lessened by following all these recommendations but I was still uncomfortable a lot of the time. I finally went to see the orthopedist in March and he said my foot \"can\" improve if I continued with the exercises, etc At the very end, he asked if he had given me the \"patch\" at my first appointment; so I left with a sample and a prescription for the Flector patch. I cut a patch (there are five in each reclosable pouch) in half and it covers the heel area. After I used it the first time, the puffiness and pain were gone! I found it best to use the patch at night only although you can replace it every 12 hours. I put the patch on at bedtime, tape the edges down and wear a sock to secure it. Initially, I used it every night and after about three weeks, was able to cut down to several times a week. It certainly helped to make the past month more comfortable.

I couldn't figure out why. I also have felt extremely fatigued and people are telling me I look really tired and asking if I'm ok. I feel like I'm in a fog and it's a chore to just walk around. Last night right.

I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery. First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor's psychiatric side effects. He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10mg Crestor. In addition, he prescribed a new medication: Niacin, beginning with 500mg the first month and then increasing to 1,000 in the second (with the ultimate aim of reaching 2,000 in the fourth monthly). Bottom line: When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165. This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124. So, after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects. Therefore, here is what I've done during the past two months: - Took 500mg of Niacin during the first months and 1,000mg during the second; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills (10mg which are equivalent to 20mg of Lipitor) per month, i.e., one every three days. - Two natural pills of Phytosterol. - A cup of tea made of olive leafs. Now, I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months (2,000mg) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 (the level required for diabetics). Good luck, folks!.

I stopped Lipitor six months ago as an experiment. Within 3 weeks I had recovered about 50%. I hve not recovered past this point. I still can't walk without extreme pain.

My GP and the surgeon who says I now need surgery on both ankles for the inflammed bursae are reluctant to connect my pain and disability. My GP still wants me on statins. She is annoyed that I will not take any. I am taking Red Yeast Rice with COQ10 now instead of a statin along with 2000 mg of Vitamin C daily. Basically Lipitor has ruined my formerly active life. No more dancing, golf, hiking, even standing too long sets my ankles on fire. I will have my cholesterol rechecked in September to see if the Red Yeast Rice helps my elevated cholesterol.

About a week ago I was taking a bath and my muscles in my lower abdomen started to contract then the cramp got higher. I got scared that I was having something bad. After the cramps one night I had such tiredness in my left leg that I could hardly walk, I thought that it was my high heels that I had worn all day. Then 2 days ago I woke up with a swollen foot, it was very painful to walk. That was it. I suspected that it was the Lipitor and came to the internet and read the same side effects in a lot of people posting their experiences with this drug. I even thought that I had ALS since a friend of mine died of it. It is amazing the amount of people that also thought the same in this list. Thanks God for the Internet. I stopped taking this medicine 2 days ago, I hope that I can get rid of these effects and that they are not permanent.

About 6 mons. ago, I decided to tell my Dr I was having muscle pain and leg cramps. He switched to Pravachol 20mg. I lasted about 2 weeks. The pain was worse. Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain. It was Statin. I looked that up and found what it does to the body. So, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up. Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10. 2 months later, the pain was back. Twice as bad as before, plus a whole bunch of other side effects, you see I'm seriuosly allergic to the Statin. And I know now, why I should have known this, but no one told me about it. When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically. When ever I drank, sipped a little wine, by body hurt so bad, I thought I had the flu. And no Aleve, or pain killer would help. I thought I was allergic to the alcohol. But now I know it was the Statin. Here are a list of the side-effects I had, that started slowly and in two years, became unbearable: Insomina,abnoraml dreams, depression, memory loss, photosensitivity, muscle pain, leg cramps, rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, dry skin, tinnitus (left ear) taste loss, dry eyes, weight gain and finally hypertension. During the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these syptoms started out slowly. First came the tinnitus. My Dr sent me to the ear Dr. Found no problem, I would have to live with it. Second, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft. Then came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinocort. During all this I felt like I was 80 years old. My neck hurt, my hips hurt. We got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain. Didn't really help. Insomia was constant. I got hooked on Tylenol PM. I gained a lot of weight. Went to Lindora to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor. Lost 40 lbs. Dr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention. This is when I decided to check it out on the internet. When I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding. That night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it. Then two days later I came down with bronhitis, and asthma. I have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years. Then I had sinus problems again. My Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear. My Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198\/90. I have never in my life had high blood pressure. Dr put me on Norvasc. Then I had two horrible nightmares. I finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor. When I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died. I have all the syptoms. I stopped taking Lipitor that instant. That was one week ago. I'm starting feel a little better. I've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem. He said, no. There is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol. The Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles. I also, asked for physical theraphy for my left shoulder and neck. My left shoulder is almost immobile. I think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor. I hope it goes away soon. I also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing.

In November of 2005 I was prescribed Lipitor for elevated cholesterol. Not really high, but high enough, dosage was only 20 mg per day. Within two months, I had developed wicked back pain, along with neuropathy and hypersensitivity that wrapped around my abdomen. We suspected the Lipitor was involved, so I went off it, since my numbers had gotten really low. I was effectively laid up for about six months. Since there was no immediate improvement, we surmised that Lipitor wasn't causing this. It's October 2006 now, and I'm starting to feel more like myself, still hurts but I can work around it. The cholesterol has crept up, so two weeks ago we started the Lipitor again, and within a few days I was paractically flat on my back again! So, I've stopped again. It's a bloody shame this is happening, as the drug was extremely effective in dropping that cholesterol. Too bad, we're going to have to try something else, I guess.

New doc gave me a different statin but I had leg cramps so he put me on Baycol. Baycol was removed from market so next doc put me back on Lipitor. My cholesterol level increased to slightly over 200 so my doc increased dosage to 40 mg a day. Hand and leg cramps returned. Hands diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome and I wore a hand brace to sleep several nights a week which controlled the symptoms. Recently developed inflammation of my foot muscles and joints and (apparently) plantar fasciitis of my left foot. Doc prescribed 800 mg Motrin qid but the foot problems became worse. General weakness in my feet, calves, and hands and tingling and burning in the soles of my feet. Depression, for which I've been taking an SSRI for about two years and may not be related to the Lipitor. I had high cholesterol (over 350) and was prescribed Lipitor in 1996 after other methods failed to have much effect. I have taken two stress tests over the past ten years and was told I had a healthy cardiovascular system with no trace of heart disease. I am 6' tall, weighed 177 lbs., and considered myself healthy until recently. I need to be able to pass a physical readiness test, including a 1.5 mile run, every 6 months because I'm in the military. I took myself off Lipitor because I can not take the physical readiness test. In fact I need a cane in the morning to get out of bed. I am not overweight. I was told to stretch and exercise more but that has not helped my symptoms, which have continued to worsen. Until recently I walked to work and shopping, 4 or 5 miles most weekdays, and more on the weekends. I also ran 2 miles, 3 times a week.

I blamed it on stress (with a dying husband), arthritis, advancing age etc and even discussed leg pain and body cramps with my doctor which he attributed chiefly to age and arthritis. I even had tests done on arteries to see if that could be the cause as I have an aortic aneurysem and thought perhaps my problems could be from poor circulation or blockage somewhere. They all checked out okay. It has been unbearable for several weeks now off and on and I suffered fatigue, lack of energy and growing depression and a feeling a fragility where I had always been a strong woman until recent years. I looked up fibromyalgia thinking I might have that but when I casually looked up lipitor the ratings leaped out at me. These people all were experiencing my symptoms!!! THANK YOU for providing this web site it may very well have saved my life. I am contacting my doctor immediately and as of now no more lipitor. It did lower my cholestral but greatly lowered my quality of life and I guess I am going to do exercise and have joined weight watchers and see if I can control it in that manner.

All of them dismissed my view that maybe the Lipitor was causing all of this even though the symptoms started about 3 weeks after uping the dosage from 20 mg. to 40. I quit taking Lipitor about a week ago - thanks in part to this web site. Within 3 days I was no longer consistently waking up at 3:00 am unable to go back to sleep.

I had a worse headache than usual (I have migraine), but who knows? Went to the internet and found this site. Saw Lipitor commercial on TV warning about muscle pain. I did not take the tablet today, and I am feeling better. I attribute the condition to the Lipitor, although there is no proof. I am a prostate cancer patient and take a number of other drugs, which raise the LDL. Apparently, some (a few) patients cannot tolerate this drug. I note that there are some on this list who have permanent damage, so it is serious for some of us. My legs are still sore, and feel worse than they did after a day of agressive downhill skiing a week ago. Apparently this works for most, but some people have a severe and not so obvious reaction. Stop immediately if there is any muscle pain.

My usual 20mg dose is taken with dinner, but I had forgotten to take it and remembered just before bedtime. I awoke at 3AM with an a knee that was just throbbing with pain. I hobbled to the bathroom and took a dose of Advil and was able to get back to sleep after about a half hour. I awoke this morning with about a 50% reduction in pain and it seems to have subsided as the day goes on. I will never take lipitor before bed again, I may cut the daily dose in half and possibly stop altogether if the pain persists at an intolerable level. Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180's. I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240's. The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor. So, all in all, the lipitor has done a good job. I will try to cope with the joint pain, but if it becomes a constant problem, I will have to stop taking the drug.

DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!. I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol. The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor. Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years. I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped. My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled. So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem. I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately. Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office. So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again. This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against. I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing. I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again. I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time. This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug. This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage. My doctor, when I told him of all this, wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol. I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor. He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said, well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect, but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed. I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up! I advise, DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!.

Within 72 hours I noted an improvement; within seven days, the symptoms were completely gone and I was restored to health.

Pfizer Inc.(maker of Lipitor) AMOUNT AT ISSUE: $$$ Pending, Cholesterol-Fighting Drug Tied to Liver, Kidney Injury, The Kahn Gauthier Law Group is investigating possible legal actions against Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), to recover for liver or kidney damage suffered by patients prescribed Lipitor. Like other drugs in its class (the statins), Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes. In clinical trials, this occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients, but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose. Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream., Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness--most commonly in the calves and lower back. Malaise, fever, dark urine, vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms. The most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure, occurring in 30-40% of the cases. Some of the warning signs of liver failure are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, and generalized skin discoloration.

The ball of my left foot was so painful I could not put pressure on it when walking so I walked on the side of my foot. Symptoms began 12 weeks after starting Lipitor. I reported to my cardiologist and internist who both denied problems were related to Lipitor because my CPK was only mildly elevated (250). I also saw a podiatrist, chiropractor, and spine specialist with no relief. When it got so bad I could not take it anymore and did not care about my cholesterol I took myself off of Lipitor and got a 50% improvement after one week. I then saw a neurologist who diagnosed me with statin induced myalgia.

The patient data is reported for him by me. Briefly, my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer (glial cell related cancer). That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor -- he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis. There were no warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards. My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient. He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards). I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this. My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden, unable to speak, feed himself, do anything for himself in 10 days. Don't know if this will really help anybody -- but just please be cautious with Rx medicines and advocate for yourself; you may not know everthing, but you do know best about what you are experiencing with these Rxs. keep doing your research, tell your doctor anything you find relevent about your life as it relates to Rxs you are given, and advocate hard for your quality of life.
