About 2 months ago while I first told my doctor I lost some body balance and it might be due to lipitor buy my doctor told me the side effect was most likely by some other reason(s). During my second visiting him, he told me my blood test CK is 90 and my muscle should be OK. Then I continued to take 10 mg lipitor, but I felt more on muscle and joint pain and I started to feel I lost some memory. Therefore, I deeply believed that I had side effects by taking lipitor. After about a week to 10 day without lipitor, I got my memory back to nomal level and my body balance is getting better. During my third doctor visit, my doctor finally believed that I got bad side effects and he told me it would take months for recovery. Now my doctor wants me to take B3 or Niaspan instead of lipitor.

When it got so bad I could not take it anymore and did not care about my cholesterol I took myself off of Lipitor and got a 50% improvement after one week.

He said he sees a lot of patients with slightly elevated CPK that many physicians do not recognized as a symptom of a statin intolerance.

Then my neck started getting stiff and the muscles are like boards they're so tight. Now the pain has gone into my shoulder and upper arm on my left side. Just last week I noticed my right arm is tight also. I can't sleep on either shoulder now. My lower back is also tight again! And I get terrible headaches from the tight neck muscles. I googled muscle pain and Lipitor showed up on the first 6 or 7 entries!! I read all the comments on this page and couldn't believe it!! I see my symptoms over and over! So, I had blood tests done this week and have elevated creatine so was told today to stop Lipitor immediately, and will see my doctor next week. After reading all these comments, I have no doubt that Lipitor is the cause of all this discomfort. I just hope and pray that I can recover from these terrible side effects. I will use vitamin C and other natural things to help my cholesterol. but if that doesn't help. hey. I'd rather die from a heart attack than die a slow painful death on Lipitor.

The patient data is reported for him by me. Briefly, my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer (glial cell related cancer). That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor -- he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis. There were no warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards. My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient. He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards). I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this. My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden, unable to speak, feed himself, do anything for himself in 10 days. Don't know if this will really help anybody -- but just please be cautious with Rx medicines and advocate for yourself; you may not know everthing, but you do know best about what you are experiencing with these Rxs. keep doing your research, tell your doctor anything you find relevent about your life as it relates to Rxs you are given, and advocate hard for your quality of life.
