This was a big relief, as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing. I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick. HOWEVER: I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn't work. I still had the other Arthrotec pills left, so I took one. Although it alleviated the pain, I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week.

The doc put me on birth control. But, the bleeding has not subsided. So now I am scheduled to have an endometrial biopsy on Wed. I had an ephiphany last night about Arthrotec and began researching the side effect. When I came across this website, I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy\/extra vaginal bleeding. I firmly believe this is the answer to my bleeding problem and will be telling the doctor on Monday,. Although this drug has helped with the pain, it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly., On top of that, I am now having to have a procedure that a 31 year old should not have to endure. I truly hope that there are no long term effects from this. I have not taken Arthrotec in almost a week, yet I am still bleeding. I do not look forward to the extra pains I will llkely experience in a couple weeks, but I am sure I can find something else to deal with them.

I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion, no signs of acid reflux, so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication. The first day I took both pills, I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps. I was at work, so I just had to brush it off. It continued each time I took it. After about two days (two doses), the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start). So, I googled the side effects of the drug, came across this site, and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects, so I felt a little better about it. On the evening of 4\/30, I suddenly got some serious chest pains, an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an \"I just finished running!\" heart rate), hot flashes, dizziness, sever stomach cramps, and weakness in my legs. I literally thought I was dying. It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day. At work (5\/1), I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened.

The pain lessened by following all these recommendations but I was still uncomfortable a lot of the time. I finally went to see the orthopedist in March and he said my foot \"can\" improve if I continued with the exercises, etc At the very end, he asked if he had given me the \"patch\" at my first appointment; so I left with a sample and a prescription for the Flector patch. I cut a patch (there are five in each reclosable pouch) in half and it covers the heel area. After I used it the first time, the puffiness and pain were gone! I found it best to use the patch at night only although you can replace it every 12 hours. I put the patch on at bedtime, tape the edges down and wear a sock to secure it. Initially, I used it every night and after about three weeks, was able to cut down to several times a week. It certainly helped to make the past month more comfortable.

I couldn't figure out why. I also have felt extremely fatigued and people are telling me I look really tired and asking if I'm ok. I feel like I'm in a fog and it's a chore to just walk around. Last night right.

I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery. First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor's psychiatric side effects. He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10mg Crestor. In addition, he prescribed a new medication: Niacin, beginning with 500mg the first month and then increasing to 1,000 in the second (with the ultimate aim of reaching 2,000 in the fourth monthly). Bottom line: When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165. This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124. So, after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects. Therefore, here is what I've done during the past two months: - Took 500mg of Niacin during the first months and 1,000mg during the second; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills (10mg which are equivalent to 20mg of Lipitor) per month, i.e., one every three days. - Two natural pills of Phytosterol. - A cup of tea made of olive leafs. Now, I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months (2,000mg) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 (the level required for diabetics). Good luck, folks!.

I stopped Lipitor six months ago as an experiment. Within 3 weeks I had recovered about 50%. I hve not recovered past this point. I still can't walk without extreme pain.

My GP and the surgeon who says I now need surgery on both ankles for the inflammed bursae are reluctant to connect my pain and disability. My GP still wants me on statins. She is annoyed that I will not take any. I am taking Red Yeast Rice with COQ10 now instead of a statin along with 2000 mg of Vitamin C daily. Basically Lipitor has ruined my formerly active life. No more dancing, golf, hiking, even standing too long sets my ankles on fire. I will have my cholesterol rechecked in September to see if the Red Yeast Rice helps my elevated cholesterol.

About 3 mos ago I had several severe left leg cramps-never had them before. Then about 2-3 weeks later, woke up and could barely stand and walk. Legs and toes were numb (worse in left), weak, back pain and calves hurt terribly. Walking was possible but only with intense effort and pain. Couldn't stand for more than 1 or 2 minutes-too painful and weak. Waited a couple 3 weeks to see if it would clear up-did not. Went to doc. Took x-rays said everything fine, blood test fine. Interested in doing MRI-thinking nacrotic nerve in lower spine. On an aside he said stop taking lipitor on an off chanch it may be an uncommon reaction. I started looking up lipitor reactions and came across so much info on side effects it was startling. I look back to about 1 1\/2 years ago when I no longer had that special feeling that all males experience in my organ and a decreased sex drive (not typical for me). At the time I attributed it to male menopause-being around 54. I went to my accupuncturist and was told my chee was dry. Had 4 treatments over as many weeks. Started to see some improvement. At the onset of symptoms I felt like I would imagine someone that had MS would feel like, swaying, pulling myself up stairs, dragging legs. After having stopped lipitor and acupuncture treatments, I would say I am at about 50 or 55%. I hope I continue to keep getting better as this has really hit my life at a bad time. My cholesterol did go down but If I knew I would have these kinds of problems I would never have started taking the drug nor will I EVER AGAIN take it irregardless of my cholesterol level. I would recommend to those who have not had any lessening of symptons to try accupuncture. It can't hurt and may help!.

He commented I see NO reason for you to be weak (Even though he prescribed the Lipitor for me) Well needless to say that was the last time I saw him.

I have very high arches and have had a little tingling in my feet for years. This is really helped with a good arch support.

The pain was so bad I could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take Advil. I asked my doctor what could have caused this and he said it was probably from the Lipitor. Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep. I had just gotten over a urinery tract infection (one of the side-effects) and I thought it had returned but the symptoms were different. I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again. I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing. I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency. I also had been experiencing lack of energy for quite some time and I attributed this to stress but after reading this website I feel it was due to the Lipitor also. I don't think I will take this drug anymore and since I read that taking vitamin C can help you with your cholesterol I think I will try this method instead. I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects.

I cannot stress this enough- my personality comepletely changed after beginning this medication. I am typically an easy going, positively thinking, emotionally stable, and motivated person. But after starting Lipitor I've gradually descended into a world of extreme anxiety, hopelessness, lonliness, and self loathing. I've never in my life been so depressed, so obsessively focused on morbid, terrifying thoughts, or so negative about everything in my life. After being off of this medication for only 48 hours, I am already beginning to see an improvement in my moods, but this will be a long journey back to my old self, I feel. Oh yes, and I also suffered from: Gas, Constipation, EXTREME FATIGUE, weight gain and bloating, and occassional bouts of diaharrea. It lowered my cholesterol, to be sure. But it also significantly lowered my quality of life. This website has been an absolute lifeline for me. My doctor had seemed so completely unwilling to accept that my symptoms could've possibly been related to my taking Lipitor. However, I know my body and know when things are not as they should be. I have been feeling this way since almost immediately after I took my first dose. Hearing that so many other people have experienced the same exact symptoms as me has given me the courage needed to STOP this medication. So many of my family members and friends have had bad reactions to this stuff- I can not trust it, and will be looking for another way to get my cholesterol under control, if possible. Be very careful and very informed before you start any new medication. Don't always trust the word of your doctor as the only word and take it at its face value. When it comes to your body, you have every right to dictate, understand, and call the shots about what does and does not go in to it.

The results were so bad in terms of side-effects that I ceased all statins and discontinued the Zetia in short order. I now take no statins, no Zetia. Individually they have their own problems; combined they are extremely dangerous and, in my opinion, should be banned as a combination therapy. Probably safe in short doses, a very bad candidate for long-term use unless closely monitored and used in lowest possible safe doseage. Would warn other patients to NOT COMBINE LIPITOR OR OTHER STATIN WITH Zetia, a common tactic that you will most likely regret.

Pain and restricted movement often prevented me from putting on shoes and socks without assistance. In January this year I started experiencing discomfort in my left hand for the first time. Now in both hands, the pain has increased, fingers are swollen and movement is restricted. My wife tells me my hands are warm to touch. The mornings are worse when they hurt the most, movement is restricted and it is impossible to make a fist. Ice and ibruprofen gel help but only for a short while. I have been taking 400 mg Ibruprofen 3 times daily for a couple of weeks on my doctors advice without. This drug is clearly POISON to so many people and perhaps there is good reason to take Pfizer to the courts. However I do believe that any Doctor prescribing Lipitor should make it abundantly clear to the patient that very serious consequences could ensue that would cause extreme pain and could effect quality of life. I believe that failure to do so is a serious deriliction of duty that should be tested with complaints to the medical authorities that oversee our doctors and\/or the courts.

I have tried all the statin drugs, you know the very expensive drug of choice for all the doc's out there. For all of you who now have extremely low LDL and a bad case of joint pain to the extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug, it is from the statins. The drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make CoQ10. This is necessary for they health of muscles and joints (that's why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness). Remember your heart is a muscle, guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the CoQ10??? If you do some research on the internet, you will find that all these statins make no claims\/nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks, but they cause muscle problems i.e. your heart, this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and. I would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130, neurosurgeons, who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low. And just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don't show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn't mean the lack of CoQ10 isn't breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly. Mine always showed fine and I had severe arthritis symptoms in knees and hip joints (never had this in my life before statins) and bad muscle cramps (also never got those until statins). Granted is you have high blood pressure, high LDL, over weight and maybe smoke, then you probably need something to lower the LDL, if you only have high LDL, you don't. Read the drug company studies, they even say it may help prevent a heart attack when you have 3 of the aforementioned risk factors.

After two weeks of decline, contacted physician, who directed me to stop both medications. One week after cessation and I am starting to feel a little better. Belatedly reading on the web about this combination (I was never informed that physical exertion can bring on these side effects) I recommend extreme caution with this combination.

I complained about this for some time finally a doctor scheduled me for a MRI. The results indicated I have arthritis so I accepted that and attributed the aches to simply getting old, (69 yrs). Two weeks ago it got so bad that I stopped my regular exercise. About a week ago, in the middle of the night after taking my usual Lipitor dose, while making my nightly trip to the toilet, a severe muscle back cramp almost sent me to the floor. After finishing my business, I hardly could sleep that night. As I got out of bed that morning I started getting severe muscle spasms in the same old place. The spasms lasted most of the day and gradually the intensity, frequency and duration diminished. Since I had done nothing recently to cause a cramp or spasm, and realizing that in the past, the back aches usually were the worst in the morning but got better during the day and best at night just before my Lipitor dose, I suspected Lipitor.

About 6 mons. ago, I decided to tell my Dr I was having muscle pain and leg cramps. He switched to Pravachol 20mg. I lasted about 2 weeks. The pain was worse. Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain. It was Statin. I looked that up and found what it does to the body. So, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up. Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10. 2 months later, the pain was back. Twice as bad as before, plus a whole bunch of other side effects, you see I'm seriuosly allergic to the Statin. And I know now, why I should have known this, but no one told me about it. When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically. When ever I drank, sipped a little wine, by body hurt so bad, I thought I had the flu. And no Aleve, or pain killer would help. I thought I was allergic to the alcohol. But now I know it was the Statin. Here are a list of the side-effects I had, that started slowly and in two years, became unbearable: Insomina,abnoraml dreams, depression, memory loss, photosensitivity, muscle pain, leg cramps, rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, dry skin, tinnitus (left ear) taste loss, dry eyes, weight gain and finally hypertension. During the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these syptoms started out slowly. First came the tinnitus. My Dr sent me to the ear Dr. Found no problem, I would have to live with it. Second, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft. Then came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinocort. During all this I felt like I was 80 years old. My neck hurt, my hips hurt. We got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain. Didn't really help. Insomia was constant. I got hooked on Tylenol PM. I gained a lot of weight. Went to Lindora to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor. Lost 40 lbs. Dr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention. This is when I decided to check it out on the internet. When I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding. That night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it. Then two days later I came down with bronhitis, and asthma. I have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years. Then I had sinus problems again. My Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear. My Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198\/90. I have never in my life had high blood pressure. Dr put me on Norvasc. Then I had two horrible nightmares. I finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor. When I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died. I have all the syptoms. I stopped taking Lipitor that instant. That was one week ago. I'm starting feel a little better. I've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem. He said, no. There is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol. The Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles. I also, asked for physical theraphy for my left shoulder and neck. My left shoulder is almost immobile. I think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor. I hope it goes away soon. I also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing. I would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug. Dr was thinking about putting on another Statin drug. I said, don't you get it, I'm allergic to it. .

We suspected the Lipitor was involved, so I went off it, since my numbers had gotten really low. I was effectively laid up for about six months. Since there was no immediate improvement, we surmised that Lipitor wasn't causing this. It's October 2006 now, and I'm starting to feel more like myself, still hurts but I can work around it. The cholesterol has crept up, so two weeks ago we started the Lipitor again, and within a few days I was paractically flat on my back again! So, I've stopped again.

New doc gave me a different statin but I had leg cramps so he put me on Baycol. Baycol was removed from market so next doc put me back on Lipitor. My cholesterol level increased to slightly over 200 so my doc increased dosage to 40 mg a day. Hand and leg cramps returned. Hands diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome and I wore a hand brace to sleep several nights a week which controlled the symptoms. Recently developed inflammation of my foot muscles and joints and (apparently) plantar fasciitis of my left foot. Doc prescribed 800 mg Motrin qid but the foot problems became worse. General weakness in my feet, calves, and hands and tingling and burning in the soles of my feet. Depression, for which I've been taking an SSRI for about two years and may not be related to the Lipitor. I had high cholesterol (over 350) and was prescribed Lipitor in 1996 after other methods failed to have much effect. I have taken two stress tests over the past ten years and was told I had a healthy cardiovascular system with no trace of heart disease. I am 6' tall, weighed 177 lbs., and considered myself healthy until recently. I need to be able to pass a physical readiness test, including a 1.5 mile run, every 6 months because I'm in the military. I took myself off Lipitor because I can not take the physical readiness test. In fact I need a cane in the morning to get out of bed. I am not overweight. I was told to stretch and exercise more but that has not helped my symptoms, which have continued to worsen. Until recently I walked to work and shopping, 4 or 5 miles most weekdays, and more on the weekends. I also ran 2 miles, 3 times a week. Now I have difficulty walking and problems with my balance and I've gained 10 pounds because I've become sedentary. Two days after taking myself off Lipitor my feet have improved a little and I'm looking forward to resuming a more active lifestyle. I think my symptoms are a result of Lipitor.

I even had tests done on arteries to see if that could be the cause as I have an aortic aneurysem and thought perhaps my problems could be from poor circulation or blockage somewhere. They all checked out okay. It has been unbearable for several weeks now off and on and I suffered fatigue, lack of energy and growing depression and a feeling a fragility where I had always been a strong woman until recent years.

All of them dismissed my view that maybe the Lipitor was causing all of this even though the symptoms started about 3 weeks after uping the dosage from 20 mg. to 40. I quit taking Lipitor about a week ago - thanks in part to this web site. Within 3 days I was no longer consistently waking up at 3:00 am unable to go back to sleep.

I had a worse headache than usual (I have migraine), but who knows? Went to the internet and found this site. Saw Lipitor commercial on TV warning about muscle pain. I did not take the tablet today, and I am feeling better. I attribute the condition to the Lipitor, although there is no proof. I am a prostate cancer patient and take a number of other drugs, which raise the LDL. Apparently, some (a few) patients cannot tolerate this drug. I note that there are some on this list who have permanent damage, so it is serious for some of us. My legs are still sore, and feel worse than they did after a day of agressive downhill skiing a week ago. Apparently this works for most, but some people have a severe and not so obvious reaction. Stop immediately if there is any muscle pain.

My usual 20mg dose is taken with dinner, but I had forgotten to take it and remembered just before bedtime. I awoke at 3AM with an a knee that was just throbbing with pain. I hobbled to the bathroom and took a dose of Advil and was able to get back to sleep after about a half hour. I awoke this morning with about a 50% reduction in pain and it seems to have subsided as the day goes on. I will never take lipitor before bed again, I may cut the daily dose in half and possibly stop altogether if the pain persists at an intolerable level. Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180's. I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240's. The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor. So, all in all, the lipitor has done a good job. I will try to cope with the joint pain, but if it becomes a constant problem, I will have to stop taking the drug.

DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!. I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol. The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor. Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years. I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped. My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled. So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem. I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately. Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office. So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again. This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against. I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing. I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again. I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time. This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug. This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage. My doctor, when I told him of all this, wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol. I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor. He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said, well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect, but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed. I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up! I advise, DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!.

Within 72 hours I noted an improvement; within seven days, the symptoms were completely gone and I was restored to health.

Pfizer Inc.(maker of Lipitor) AMOUNT AT ISSUE: $$$ Pending, Cholesterol-Fighting Drug Tied to Liver, Kidney Injury, The Kahn Gauthier Law Group is investigating possible legal actions against Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), to recover for liver or kidney damage suffered by patients prescribed Lipitor. Like other drugs in its class (the statins), Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes. In clinical trials, this occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients, but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose. Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream., Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness--most commonly in the calves and lower back. Malaise, fever, dark urine, vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms. The most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure, occurring in 30-40% of the cases. Some of the warning signs of liver failure are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, and generalized skin discoloration.
