Within two months, I had developed wicked back pain, along with neuropathy and hypersensitivity that wrapped around my abdomen. We suspected the Lipitor was involved, so I went off it, since my numbers had gotten really low. I was effectively laid up for about six months. Since there was no immediate improvement, we surmised that Lipitor wasn't causing this. It's October 2006 now, and I'm starting to feel more like myself, still hurts but I can work around it. The cholesterol has crept up, so two weeks ago we started the Lipitor again, and within a few days I was paractically flat on my back again! So, I've stopped again. It's a bloody shame this is happening, as the drug was extremely effective in dropping that cholesterol. Too bad, we're going to have to try something else, I guess.

New doc gave me a different statin but I had leg cramps so he put me on Baycol. Baycol was removed from market so next doc put me back on Lipitor. My cholesterol level increased to slightly over 200 so my doc increased dosage to 40 mg a day. Hand and leg cramps returned. Hands diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome and I wore a hand brace to sleep several nights a week which controlled the symptoms. Recently developed inflammation of my foot muscles and joints and (apparently) plantar fasciitis of my left foot. Doc prescribed 800 mg Motrin qid but the foot problems became worse. General weakness in my feet, calves, and hands and tingling and burning in the soles of my feet. Depression, for which I've been taking an SSRI for about two years and may not be related to the Lipitor. I had high cholesterol (over 350) and was prescribed Lipitor in 1996 after other methods failed to have much effect. I have taken two stress tests over the past ten years and was told I had a healthy cardiovascular system with no trace of heart disease. I am 6' tall, weighed 177 lbs., and considered myself healthy until recently. I need to be able to pass a physical readiness test, including a 1.5 mile run, every 6 months because I'm in the military. I took myself off Lipitor because I can not take the physical readiness test. In fact I need a cane in the morning to get out of bed. I am not overweight. I was told to stretch and exercise more but that has not helped my symptoms, which have continued to worsen. Until recently I walked to work and shopping, 4 or 5 miles most weekdays, and more on the weekends. I also ran 2 miles, 3 times a week.

I blamed it on stress (with a dying husband), arthritis, advancing age etc and even discussed leg pain and body cramps with my doctor which he attributed chiefly to age and arthritis. I even had tests done on arteries to see if that could be the cause as I have an aortic aneurysem and thought perhaps my problems could be from poor circulation or blockage somewhere. They all checked out okay. It has been unbearable for several weeks now off and on and I suffered fatigue, lack of energy and growing depression and a feeling a fragility where I had always been a strong woman until recent years. I looked up fibromyalgia thinking I might have that but when I casually looked up lipitor the ratings leaped out at me. These people all were experiencing my symptoms!!! THANK YOU for providing this web site it may very well have saved my life. I am contacting my doctor immediately and as of now no more lipitor. It did lower my cholestral but greatly lowered my quality of life and I guess I am going to do exercise and have joined weight watchers and see if I can control it in that manner.

All of them dismissed my view that maybe the Lipitor was causing all of this even though the symptoms started about 3 weeks after uping the dosage from 20 mg. to 40. I quit taking Lipitor about a week ago - thanks in part to this web site. Within 3 days I was no longer consistently waking up at 3:00 am unable to go back to sleep.

I had a worse headache than usual (I have migraine), but who knows? Went to the internet and found this site. Saw Lipitor commercial on TV warning about muscle pain. I did not take the tablet today, and I am feeling better. I attribute the condition to the Lipitor, although there is no proof. I am a prostate cancer patient and take a number of other drugs, which raise the LDL. Apparently, some (a few) patients cannot tolerate this drug. I note that there are some on this list who have permanent damage, so it is serious for some of us. My legs are still sore, and feel worse than they did after a day of agressive downhill skiing a week ago. Apparently this works for most, but some people have a severe and not so obvious reaction. Stop immediately if there is any muscle pain.

My usual 20mg dose is taken with dinner, but I had forgotten to take it and remembered just before bedtime. I awoke at 3AM with an a knee that was just throbbing with pain. I hobbled to the bathroom and took a dose of Advil and was able to get back to sleep after about a half hour. I awoke this morning with about a 50% reduction in pain and it seems to have subsided as the day goes on. I will never take lipitor before bed again, I may cut the daily dose in half and possibly stop altogether if the pain persists at an intolerable level. Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180's. I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240's. The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor. So, all in all, the lipitor has done a good job. I will try to cope with the joint pain, but if it becomes a constant problem, I will have to stop taking the drug.

DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!. I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol. The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor. Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years. I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped. My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled. So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem. I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately. Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office. So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again. This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against. I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing. I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again. I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time. This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug. This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage. My doctor, when I told him of all this, wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol. I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor. He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said, well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect, but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed. I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up! I advise, DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!.

Within 72 hours I noted an improvement; within seven days, the symptoms were completely gone and I was restored to health.

Pfizer Inc.(maker of Lipitor) AMOUNT AT ISSUE: $$$ Pending, Cholesterol-Fighting Drug Tied to Liver, Kidney Injury, The Kahn Gauthier Law Group is investigating possible legal actions against Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), to recover for liver or kidney damage suffered by patients prescribed Lipitor. Like other drugs in its class (the statins), Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes. In clinical trials, this occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients, but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose. Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream., Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness--most commonly in the calves and lower back. Malaise, fever, dark urine, vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms. The most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure, occurring in 30-40% of the cases. Some of the warning signs of liver failure are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, and generalized skin discoloration.
